First a son,

Then a student,

Then a friend,

and life goes on.

From a colleague to the boss,

To someone's Rachel, you are Ross

Then you become a father, a guide,

Life takes you on a wild ride!

Then the grandfather who gets candy,

Or everyone's favourite uncle with brandy!

There are many roles you play,

and smile throughout the day.

Kudos to all you've done,

With you, life is fun!
